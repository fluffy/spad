1.  Introduction

   Simple Port and Address Discovery (SPAD) allows an web application to
   inform others of what ports and IP addresses it uses so that things
   like firewalls can correctly re-configure themsleves as the ports and
   addresses change.  Applications are identified by a domain name which
   is used to form a URL in a well known location where a client can do
   a HTTP REST call to get a JSON file that describes information about
   what addresses and transport the service uses.

2.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD
   NOT", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   RAML is defined at <https://github.com/raml-org>.

   JSON Schema is defined at <http://json-schema.org/>.  Further
   information is available in [I-D.wright-json-schema].

Internet-Draft                    SPAD                       August 2017


3.  Example

   To figure out what IP addresses are used by the service example.com,
   the first step is to form the query URL by constructing an endpoint
   at ".well-known/spad/v0/spad".

   Then an HTTPS GET query is done that to that URL.

             curl https://example.com/.well-known/spad/v0/spad

   The responses would be a JSON result that might look like

       {
           "ietf-spad:spad": {
               "domain": "example.com",
               "services": [
                   {
                       "name": "example-service",
                       "validTill": "Fri 11 Nov 2016 22:20:08 UTC",
                       "flows": [
                           {
                               "ips": [
                   "203.0.113.2"
                               ],
                               "port": 443,
                               "protocol": "https"
                           }
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           }
       }

   The example above indicates that the "example.com" application has a
   single service with a single flow that uses only the HTTPS to connect
   to port 443 on the IP address "203.0.113.2".  This SPAD information
   is not valid after "Fri 11 Nov 2016 22:20:08 UTC" and a new SPAD file
   should be retrieved before that point in time.

   The following shows a more complex example result for an application
   that uses two flows.  One is TLS to the SIP port of a server with an
   v4 and v6 address.  The TLS connection will have a name of
   example.com in the SNI.  The other flow is media sent over UDP to
   port 5004 on a few different ip addresses.  If devices in the network
   are capable of remarking DSCP, the desired marking is "AF41".

               ]

       }

4.  Protocols

   The protocol field is filled out with the most specific instance of a
   well defined protocol that is running.  Any protocols that are
   implied as the normal default by this that it runs over are omitted.
   For example, HTTPS runs over TLS over TCP over IP.  In this case the
   only thing listed is HTTPS.  However if HTTPS was being used over
   SCTP which is not the normal thing, and the SCTP was over UDP which
   is also not the default, then it would be listed at HTTPS/SCTP/UDP
   but IP is not added as that is the normal thing for UDP to be over.

   URI scheme from <https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-
   schemes.xhtml>. is preferred thing to use if defined, followed by the
   service name from <https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-
   port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml> followed by the

Appendix A.  Development of this Specification

A.1.  Specification Style

   The specification style is "less is more."  If a reasonable developer
   who is fully up on modern web development practices could figure out
   how write an interoperable implementation after looking at some
   examples and code and asking a few questions, well that's good enough
   for us.  If you can find it on Wikipedia, we don't need to explain it
   here.

   The build chain allows for an internet draft to be produced from
   separate parts: a basic draft skeleton that includes narrative text;
   examples; an API specification; and a schema.  Markdown is used for
   text.  RAML and JSON Schema are used to describe the API.  Examples
   play a central role in the specification.  The build chain has the
   goal of being simple and obvious with no black magic.

A.2.  Following Discussion

   We welcome all contributions.  Discussion takes place in a few
   places:

   o  We discuss specific issues on the appropriate issues list in
      Github [1].  If you don't want to use Github to follow these
      discussions, you can subscribe to the issue announce list [2].

   o  Our mailing list [3] is used for confirmation of consensus.

A.3.  Resolving Issues

   Consensus for the resolution of an issue can be established through
   discussion on the issues list.  Once a resolution is found, the issue
   will be labeled as "editor-ready".  The editor will then write a pull
   request suggesting the specific changes to make to resolve the issue.
   Consensus to adopt the change will be judged on the mailing list.
   Once a pull request has consensus, the editor will merge it and close
   the issue.

A.4.  Pull Requests

   We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to
   resolve open issues.  In the latter case, please identify the
   relevant issue.

Internet-Draft                    SPAD                       August 2017


   Please do not use a pull request to open a new design issue; it may
   not be noticed.

A.5.  Published Versions

   The web site at (<https://coopdanger.github.io/spad/>) provides an
   overview of the specification that is focused on a developer
   audience.  However, all the key information to implement the
   specification that is used to generate the web site is also used to
   generate and internet draft that can be found at draft-jennings-
   dispatch-spad-v0 [4].

   Periodically the information on the master is branched to a versioned
   draft branch and the content of that branch is used to produce an
   updated version of the internet draft.  A typical cadence for this is
   monthly so that the draft can receive broader review.

   When the work is at a good point to form a stable version of the API,
   it is progressed through the IETF publication process with the goal
   of publishing an RFC.  Once approved, the text of the RFC is used to
   form a released version of the API.  The first version would be v1.
   The current working pre-standard version is always referred to as v0.
   The API includes the version in the URL so that developers can
   implement to a specific non-changing specification.  Future versions
   attempt, but do not guarantee, to be backwards-compatible with the
   previous version.
